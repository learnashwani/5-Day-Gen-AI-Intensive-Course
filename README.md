# 5-Day-Gen-AI-Intensive-Course
Hello Ashwani,

Welcome to our 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google! 

This email includes a brief summary of how the course works and instructions on how to get set up. Tomorrow you’ll receive your first assignment.

How the Course Works:

1. Everyday, you’ll receive an email with assignments. The assignments include an optional podcast episode, new whitepapers to read, and code labs.
2. While completing the assignments, you’ll be able to ask questions and discuss with other participants on our Discord channel. The channel will occasionally be monitored by several Google ML researchers and engineers who can answer questions.
3. Everyday, Paige Bailey will host a YouTube livestream at 11am ET/8 am PT starting on Monday, Nov 11th. She’ll be joined by special guests from Google. After the livestream, the recording will be shared on Discord.
4. If you complete all of the code labs on Kaggle, by Friday, November 22nd you’ll receive a Kaggle badge on your profile!
